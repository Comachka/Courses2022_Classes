1. Given a Point class that defines a point on a coordinate plane (x,y). Implement counting the number of created instances of the Point type. Add a static method LengthPoints() to calculate the distance between two points. The method should receive instances of the Point type as parameters. The Point class is declared as non-static.

2. Describe the "Employee" class. Describe the "Company" class that allows for firing, changing the position, and changing the employee's salary.

3. Describe the abstract class "Home Appliance". Create two abstract methods. Create the "Washing Machine" and "Dishwasher" classes by inheriting from the "Home Appliance" class and implementing the abstract methods in them.

PS In classes 2 and 3, there should be at least five properties, develop business logic, and add constraints to properties (at least 1 constraint in each class).
